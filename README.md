# Webru

The easiest way to hack your switch.

# How it works

Webru uses CaptiveDNS to make a DNS that redirects your switch to the Webru launcher. 

The Webru launcher simply redirects you to my Google sites page full of fun stuff and homebrew. In the website, there is also a homebrew loader that can run homebrew you guys can make.

# Posting homebrew to Webru

Posting homebrew is not currently avalible. This feature is being worked on currently.

# QnA

**Why did you make this if the Switch 2 is out?**

1. The switch 2 has no exploits yet.
2. The switch 2 is expensive and this is for people who can't get the switch 2.

**Didn't SwitchDNS pull this off first?**

Yes, SwitchDNS did do this first, our work is actually inspired off of it. But our work is supposed to be like Nintendo but we focus on user experience.
